Hi, I'm Dave, a Support Engineer, Web Developer and UK Sole Trader.

I'm the author and maintainer of [Sheldon](https://github.com/dvjones89/sheldon){:target="_blank"}, an open-source dotfile manager written in Ruby. I also develop [FurAgent](https://github.com/dvjones89/furagent){:target="_blank"}, an Elixir web application that integrates with FreeAgent and simplifies invoice creation for service-based businesses.

I studied Internet Computer Science at [St Andrews](http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} (BSc First-class Hons) and currently work as a Senior Support Engineer at [FreeAgent](https://www.freeagent.com){:target="_blank"}.

I like to help people through technology, building products and processes that improve people's lives.
